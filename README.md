       (eq (:dept-id employee) (:id dept) (:dept-id colleague))

({:dept "Maintenance",
  :employees #{{:name "Homer Simpson", :colleagues #{}}}}

     (sql (collect {:dept (:name dept)
                    :employees (many {:name (:name employee)
                                      :colleagues (many (:name colleague))})}
            (eq (:dept-id employee) (:id dept) (:dept-id colleague))
            (neq (:id employee) (:id colleague)))))
"SELECT dept.name, employee.name, employee27734.name 
 FROM (dept dept JOIN employee employee ON employee.dept_id=dept.id) 
      LEFT JOIN (employee employee27734) ON (employee27734.id!=employee.id) AND employee27734.dept_id=dept.id 
 ORDER BY dept.name"
